I don’t have access to your internal case database or tooling, so I can’t look up case `6b742b58-564e-4320-8598-11599d7a28f3` directly.

If you paste or upload the relevant extraction log, case notes, or a screenshot for that case, I can:

- Identify and summarize the acquisition/extraction steps (tooling, source media, method, scope, hashes, verification).
- Highlight any irregularities (retries, errors, fallbacks to different methods).
- Produce a concise bullet-point summary suitable for inclusion in your DFIR report.
