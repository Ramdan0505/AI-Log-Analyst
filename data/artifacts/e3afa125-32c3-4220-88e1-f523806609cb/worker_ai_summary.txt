I don’t have access to your internal case system, so I can’t look up case `e3afa125-32c3-4220-88e1-f523806609cb` or its specific extraction log.

If you paste in the extraction notes, tool output, or a timeline for that case, I can:

- Condense it into a clear step‑by‑step extraction summary  
- Distinguish between acquisition, verification, parsing, and export steps  
- Highlight any anomalies, errors, or deviations from SOPs  

Without that data, I can only describe a generic DFIR extraction workflow (e.g., identification → acquisition → verification → parsing → export), but that wouldn’t be specific to your case ID.
