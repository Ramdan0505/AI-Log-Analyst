I don’t have access to your internal case management system or its contents, so I can’t see the specific details for case `7c537f99-fd22-453d-8fc4-64387b0a33f1`.

If you can provide either:
- the existing notes/log for the extraction phase of that case, or  
- a brief description of the acquisition sources (e.g., “Windows 10 laptop via FTK Imager and GrayKey, plus O365 mailbox export”),

I can then summarize the extraction steps in a concise, case-ready format.
