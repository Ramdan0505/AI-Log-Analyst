I don’t have access to your case management system or any internal repository, so I can’t see the specific artifacts or workflow tied to case ID `6aa73d27-bf38-4c0c-9b28-eeeeb606643c`.

If you paste in the case notes, extraction log, or a relevant snippet (e.g., tool output, timeline of actions), I can then:

- Summarize the extraction steps that were performed,
- Organize them by source (e.g., disk, memory, cloud, mobile),
- Highlight any gaps or follow‑up steps that may be needed.
