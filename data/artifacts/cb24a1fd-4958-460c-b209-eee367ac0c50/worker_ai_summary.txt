I don’t have direct access to your case management system or its contents, so I can’t see the specific artifacts or workflow tied to case `cb24a1fd-4958-460c-b209-eee367ac0c50`.

If you paste or describe the extraction log/steps (e.g., tool output, acquisition notes, or a brief timeline of what was done), I can:

- Condense them into a clear, bullet-point summary, and  
- Organize them by phase (identification, acquisition, verification, parsing, export), device, or tool as needed.

Please provide the relevant text or screenshots (with sensitive data redacted if required), and specify whether you want a brief bullet list or a more detailed procedural summary.
