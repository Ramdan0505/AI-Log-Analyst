I don’t have direct access to your case management system or its contents, so I can’t see what “case 86d0a9b4-99ec-47ec-adc9-96dd56eae054” refers to or what was done in it.

If you paste in or upload:

- The extraction log(s), or  
- The workflow / notes for that case, or  
- A screenshot or export from your DFIR tool

I can then:

- Identify the extraction stages that were performed (e.g., acquisition, verification, parsing, carving, triage, export), and  
- Produce a concise, step‑by‑step summary tailored to that specific case.
