I don’t have direct access to your case repository or internal tracking system, so I can’t look up “case 948721d0-b71a-4b04-858c-9a3cb19d5d26” or see its specific extraction workflow.

If you paste in the case notes, tool logs, or extraction playbook for that case (or describe what evidence types were handled—e.g., Windows disk image, iOS device, cloud artifacts), I can:

- Summarize the exact extraction steps that were taken, in order.
- Distill them into a concise checklist or SOP-style outline.
- Highlight tools used, acquisition methods (live vs dead-box), and verification steps (hashing, chain-of-custody, etc.).

Provide any relevant text or screenshots, and I’ll produce a precise summary tailored to that case.
