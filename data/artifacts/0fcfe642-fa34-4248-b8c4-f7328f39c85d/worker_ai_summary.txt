I don’t have access to your internal case management system or its contents, so I can’t see what “case 0fcfe642-fa34-4248-b8c4-f7328f39c85d” refers to or what was done in that specific matter.

If you paste in (or attach) the case notes, acquisition logs, or a timeline for that case, I can:

- Extract and list the acquisition / extraction steps in order  
- Normalize tool names, versions, and settings used  
- Highlight any gaps (e.g., missing hashes, incomplete chain-of-custody details)  

Alternatively, if you just want a generic DFIR “extraction steps” template (e.g., for disk, mobile, or cloud), tell me the evidence type and I’ll summarize a standard, defensible extraction workflow.
