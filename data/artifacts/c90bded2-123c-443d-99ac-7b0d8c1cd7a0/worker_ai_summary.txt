I don’t have access to your internal case repository, so I can’t see what was actually done in case `c90bded2-123c-443d-99ac-7b0d8c1cd7a0`.  

If you provide either:
- the case notes / timeline, or  
- the tool logs (e.g., Cellebrite, X-Ways, FTK, KAPE, etc.),  

I can summarize the specific extraction steps for that case.

In the meantime, here’s a concise generic template you can adapt to your case:

1. **Evidence Intake & Verification**
   - Received items: [device(s), media, images].
   - Logged under evidence ID(s): [IDs].
   - Verified integrity using cryptographic hashes (e.g., MD5/SHA-1/SHA-256).
   - Photographed and documented device condition and labels.

2. **Preparation**
   - Established forensic workstation and write‑blocking setup.
   - Confirmed tool versions and time synchronization.
   - Ensured chain‑of‑custody documentation was complete.

3. **Acquisition / Extraction**
   - Forensic imaging of storage media (e.g., `dd`, FTK Imager, X-Ways):
     - Mode: [physical / logical / targeted].
     - Output format: [E01 / RAW / AFF].
     - Verified image with hash comparison.
   - For mobile devices:
     - Used [tool] (e.g., Cellebrite/GrayKey/Magnet AXIOM).
     - Extraction type: [logical / file system / full physical].
     - Captured device metadata (IMEI, serial, OS version, lock state).

4. **Live / Volatile Data (if applicable)**
   - Captured RAM with [tool].
   - Collected volatile artifacts (network connections, running processes, logged‑in users).

5. **Triage Collections (if applicable)**
   - Used [KAPE/Velociraptor/GRR/etc.] to collect targeted artifacts:
     - System info, event logs, browser data, registry hives, user profiles, etc.

6. **Post‑Acquisition Validation**
   - Recomputed hashes of all images/extracts.
   - Cross‑checked against original media hashes.
   - Documented any read errors or bad sectors.

7. **Storage & Documentation**
   - Stored images and exports on evidence storage with access controls.
   - Updated chain‑of‑custody and examination log with:
     - Date/time of extraction
     - Examiner
     - Tools and versions
     - Any deviations or issues encountered.

Paste the relevant case log or tool report, and I’ll convert it into a precise, case‑specific extraction step summary.
